#Real Estate

Minimal React + Vite starter for the Hindu Sangamam invite site.

**Node:** v20.19.1 (use `nvm use` if you have `nvm` installed)

## Run

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs the Vite dev server with hot reload. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

To show a short run note before the server starts (useful locally), run:

```bash
npm run dev
# prints a short message via the predev script, then starts Vite
```

## Notes

- Linting: run `npm run lint` to check code with ESLint.
- Build: run `npm run build` to produce a production build.

For more about React + Vite configuration and plugins, see the Vite documentation.
